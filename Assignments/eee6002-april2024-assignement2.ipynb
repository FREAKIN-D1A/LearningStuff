    "   - The first qubit should apply $n$ instances of the Pauli-X gate.\n",
    "   - The second qubit should apply $n - 1$ instances of the Hadamard gate.\n",
    "   - The third qubit should apply $24 - n - 2$ instances of the Pauli-Z gate.\n",
    "   - Continue this pattern until you cover all $n$ qubits or you run out of unique gate sequences.\n",
